'''
We'll show you how to declare such multi-value variables. 
We'll do this with the example we just suggested. 
We'll write a program that sorts a sequence of numbers. 
We won't be particularly ambitious - we'll assume that there are exactly five numbers.

Let's create a variable called numbers; it's assigned with not just one number, 
but is filled with a list consisting of five values (note: the list starts with an open square 
bracket and ends with a closed square bracket; the space between the brackets is filled with 
five numbers separated by commas).
'''

numbers = [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]
